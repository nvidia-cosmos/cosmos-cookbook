# How to Contribute

We'd love to receive your patches and contributions. Please keep your PRs as draft until such time that you would like us to review them.

## Sharing Your Success Stories

Since this is a playbook documenting the Cosmos ecosystem, we especially welcome hearing your successful stories on how you've creatively used Cosmos models or repositories for different purposes. Whether you've adapted models for novel applications, discovered innovative workflows, or achieved impressive results in specific domains, your experiences help make this playbook more valuable for the entire community.

### Dataset Licensing Requirements

Before contributing content that includes datasets or data examples:

1. **License Verification**: Ensure that any dataset used in your contribution is properly cleared in terms of licensing for demonstration and promotional purposes related to Cosmos models.

2. **Documentation**: Include clear attribution and licensing information for any datasets referenced in your contribution.

By contributing your successful stories and examples, you agree to these terms regarding dataset licensing and usage rights.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
