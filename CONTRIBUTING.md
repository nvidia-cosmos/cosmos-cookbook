# How to Contribute

We'd love to receive your patches and contributions. Please keep your PRs as draft until such time that you would like us to review them.

## Open Source Contributions Welcome

We warmly welcome open source contributions to the Cosmos Cookbook! This is a community-driven playbook documenting the Cosmos ecosystem, and we especially value your participation in the following ways:

### Sharing Your Success Stories and Practical Recipes

We'd love to hear your successful stories about how you've creatively used Cosmos models or repositories for different purposes, as well as practical recipes that you think others might benefit from learning. Whether you've:

- Adapted models for novel applications
- Discovered innovative workflows  
- Achieved impressive results in specific domains
- Developed useful techniques or best practices
- Found creative solutions to common challenges

Your experiences and knowledge help make this cookbook more valuable for the entire community.

### How to Contribute

**For Complete Stories Ready to Share:**
- **Raise a Pull Request** if your story is complete and ready to merge
- We will review your contribution and get back to you within a week
- Please keep your PRs as draft until you're ready for our review

**For Ideas and Incomplete Stories:**
- **Share in the Issues Board** if you have interest in sharing but don't have time to write up the complete story

### Dataset Licensing Requirements

Before contributing content that includes datasets or data examples:

1. **License Verification**: Ensure that any dataset used in your contribution is properly cleared in terms of licensing for demonstration and promotional purposes related to Cosmos models.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
