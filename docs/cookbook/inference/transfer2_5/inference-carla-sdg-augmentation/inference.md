- [Setup and System Requirement](setup.md)

## Why Simulator-to-Real Augmentation Matters

Creating diverse, photorealistic training data from simulators faces significant challenges:

- **Domain Gap**: While simulators provide perfect ground truth and controllable scenarios, their synthetic appearance creates a substantial domain gap that limits the performance of models trained on simulator data when deployed in real-world environments.

- **Scalability Constraints**: Manually crafting diverse scenarios in simulators requires substantial engineering effort and computational resources, making it prohibitively expensive to scale up data diversity.

- **Limited Visual Realism**: Traditional simulator outputs lack the photorealistic quality needed for robust real-world model deployment, requiring additional post-processing or domain adaptation techniques.

This creates a great opportunity for utilizing Cosmos Transfer 2.5 to transform simulator outputs into photorealistic, diverse datasets that bridge the sim-to-real gap and improve downstream model performance in real-world deployment.

## Demonstration Overview

This is a demonstration of **Cosmos Transfer 2.5** being used for simulator-to-real augmentation of synthetic data. This tutorial walks through a step-by-step process of transforming synthetic simulator outputs into photorealistic, diverse datasets. By leveraging Cosmos Transfer 2.5's advanced generative capabilities, we showcase how to bridge the sim-to-real gap while maintaining the structural integrity and semantic information from the original simulator data.

## Creating Anomaly Scenarios in Simulators

### The Challenge of Manual Scenario Creation

Creating traffic anomaly scenarios in simulators requires manual effort and technical expertise:

- **Map Design**: Custom road networks must be manually constructed or modified to support specific anomaly scenarios
- **Traffic Setup**: Each vehicle needs individual placement, trajectory planning, and behavior scripting
- **Anomaly Engineering**: Wrong-way driving behaviors require careful programming to ensure realistic yet unsafe patterns
- **Camera Configuration**: Multiple viewpoints must be positioned and calibrated to capture the anomaly from relevant angles
- **Environment Tuning**: Lighting, weather, and time-of-day settings need manual adjustment for each variation

This labor-intensive process makes it prohibitively expensive to create diverse anomaly datasets at scale.

### Wrong-Way Driving Scenario

The demonstration video showcases a critical traffic safety scenario captured in the simulator's synthetic environment:

> "The scene depicts a large urban intersection marked with a prominent yellow grid box to prevent vehicles from blocking the crossing, surrounded by multiple lanes with clearly defined stop lines, crosswalks, and sidewalks lined with streetlights, palm trees, and banners. Traffic lights hang overhead, coordinating flows from all directions, with most vehicles orderly queued at red signals or moving forward on green, while one vehicle is notably traveling against the proper lane direction, creating a wrong-way traffic anomaly. The background features tall, detailed stone and glass buildings with arched entrances, a mix of modern and classical architectural styles, along with visible signage and distant street activity, giving the environment a realistic, bustling city atmosphere."

This complex urban scenario demonstrates:

- **Traffic Anomaly**: One vehicle driving against the proper lane direction amidst otherwise orderly traffic
- **Rich Urban Context**: Detailed intersection with traffic infrastructure, buildings, and urban elements
- **Synthetic Appearance**: Despite the detailed scene composition, the characteristic rendering style reveals its simulator origin
- **Safety-Critical Behavior**: The wrong-way vehicle creates a dangerous situation that autonomous systems must detect

### Available Ground Truth from the Simulator

The simulator provides comprehensive ground truth data for each frame:

</div>

These control signals serve as the foundation for Cosmos Transfer 2.5's photorealistic augmentation while ensuring the anomaly behavior is preserved.

## Prompt Engineering for Photorealistic Augmentation

### Transforming Synthetic Data Through Strategic Prompting

Cosmos Transfer 2.5 leverages carefully crafted prompts to transform synthetic simulator outputs into photorealistic scenes. The key to successful augmentation lies in three critical components:

1. **Positive Prompts**: Detailed descriptions that guide the model toward photorealistic qualities while preserving the anomaly behavior
2. **Negative Prompts**: Constraints that prevent unrealistic artifacts and maintain structural integrity
3. **Model's Inherent Capabilities**: Cosmos Transfer 2.5's understanding of real-world physics and lighting to enhance realism

### Scene Understanding with Physical AI Model Cosmos-Reason1

Our prompt engineering pipeline leverages Cosmos-Reason1, a model densely trained on AV and robotics data for superior physical scene understanding, in a two-stage approach to embed specific variations into the scene description:

#### Stage 1: Global Scene Captioning

We use Cosmos-Reason1 (7B) to generate a comprehensive caption that captures all scene elements with physical AI expertise:

- Traffic infrastructure (roads, intersections, traffic lights)
- Vehicles and their behaviors (including anomalies)
- Environmental context (buildings, vegetation, urban features)
- Current conditions (time of day, weather, visibility)

#### Stage 2: Variation-Specific Augmentation

The global caption is then processed by Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to inject specific augmentation keywords while preserving the core scene structure. The LLM is prompted with:

- The original global caption from Cosmos-Reason1
- Target variation keywords (e.g., "night", "snow falling", "puddles")
- Instructions to realistically modify only the relevant aspects

This approach ensures that the anomaly behavior and scene structure remain intact while only the desired visual attributes are transformed. Cosmos-Reason1's specialized training on autonomous vehicle and robotics data ensures accurate understanding of spatial relationships, vehicle dynamics, and traffic scenarios that are critical for maintaining ground truth integrity during augmentation.

### Augmentation Categories and Prompt Design

To maximize data diversity, we employ 18 distinct augmentation types organized into three high-level categories:

| Category | Conditions & Augmentation Ideas |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| **Environment Lighting** | **Sunrise**: Warm morning light, long shadows, orange–pink eastern sky<br>**Sunset**: Warm evening light, long shadows, orange–pink western sky<br>**Twilight**: Cool blue cast, low ambient light, diffused backgrounds<br>**Mid-morning**: Clear daylight, balanced shadows, crisp textures<br>**Afternoon**: Neutral daylight, natural shadows, bright exposure<br>**Zenith**: Harsh overhead light, short shadows, strong contrast<br>**Golden hour**: Soft warm tones, elongated shadows, enhanced depth<br>**Blue hour**: Deep blue tones, low light, soft ambient illumination<br>**Night**: Low light, high contrast, vehicle/headlight glow, streetlamps |
| **Weather** | **Clear Sky**: High visibility, distinct shadows, light blue gradient<br>**Overcast**: Flat diffuse lighting, gray/white sky, reduced shadows<br>**Snow Falling**: Snow overlays, cold white balance, desaturated tone<br>**Raining**: Rain streaks, puddle reflections, wet road sheen<br>**Fog**: Depth-based haze, white/gray overlay, obscured distance |
| **Road Surface** | **Dry road**: Clean asphalt, visible lane markings, consistent reflectance<br>**Snow on ground**: White surface cover, tire tracks, snow piles<br>**Sand on ground**: Light tan surface, granular texture, dust haze<br>**Puddles**: Water accumulation, mirror-like reflections, ripples |

### Preserving Anomaly Behaviors

When crafting prompts for each augmentation, special attention is given to:

- **Maintaining Visibility**: Ensuring the wrong-way vehicle remains detectable across all conditions
- **Preserving Spatial Relationships**: Keeping relative positions and trajectories intact
- **Enhancing Realism**: Adding photorealistic elements without obscuring safety-critical features

Example prompt structure for snow-covered ground augmentation:

**Positive Prompt:**

```
"The video depicts a bustling urban intersection during daytime, with clear skies and ample sunlight illuminating the scene, casting a pale light on the snow-covered ground. The environment is characterized by modern buildings with large windows and classical architectural elements, suggesting a cityscape that blends contemporary and historical design. The intersection is marked with yellow grid lines on the road, now partially obscured by a layer of snow, indicating pedestrian crossing areas. Several vehicles are present, including a red car in the foreground moving diagonally across the intersection, leaving behind dark tire tracks in the snow, a black SUV turning right, and other cars in various colors such as blue, white, and green, all navigating through the busy street, their tires creating visible grooves in the snow. Traffic lights are visible at the intersection, with some showing red signals, and snow piles are accumulated along road edges and curbs."
```

**Negative Prompt:**

```
"The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all."
```

This prompt engineering approach ensures that:

- The anomaly (vehicle moving diagonally/wrong-way) remains clearly visible
- Snow effects are realistically applied without obscuring critical details
- The synthetic appearance is transformed into photorealistic quality
- Ground truth information from the simulator is preserved

## Cosmos Transfer 2.5 Output Examples

### Comparing Control Model Impacts

To demonstrate the versatility of Cosmos Transfer 2.5, we showcase outputs using different control configurations across our three augmentation categories. Each control model (depth, segmentation, and edge) produces distinct photorealistic transformations while preserving the critical anomaly behavior.

### Selected Augmentation Examples

To showcase the versatility of Cosmos Transfer 2.5, we present five representative augmentations demonstrating different environmental conditions and control strategies:

#### 1. Night Augmentation (Using Depth Control)

### Key Observations

- **Depth Control**: Best for maintaining 3D spatial consistency and realistic occlusions
- **Segmentation Control**: Optimal for preserving semantic boundaries and object-specific transformations
- **Edge Control**: Excellent for retaining structural details and geometric precision

All outputs successfully transform the synthetic appearance into photorealistic scenes while ensuring the wrong-way vehicle anomaly remains clearly detectable for training robust safety systems.

## Control Parameters in Cosmos Transfer 2.5

### Configuration Structure

Cosmos Transfer 2.5 provides flexible control parameters that allow fine-tuning of the augmentation process. The configuration determines how closely the output adheres to the structural information from the simulator while achieving photorealistic transformation.

### Basic Configuration Format

The configuration file follows a JSON structure that specifies the input paths, output directory, and control parameters:

```json
{
    "prompt_path": "assets/car_example/car_prompt.json",
    "output_dir": "outputs/car_edge",
    "video_path": "assets/car_example/car_input.mp4",
    "control_weight": 1.0,
    "edge": {
        "control_path": "assets/car_example/edge/car_edge.mp4"
    }
}
```

### Control Types

To use different control types, simply replace `"edge"` in the configuration with `"seg"` for segmentation control or `"depth"` for depth control, updating the control_path accordingly.

## Maintaining Ground Truth Integrity

### Preserving Critical Anomaly Behaviors

A fundamental requirement for simulator-to-real augmentation is maintaining the integrity of ground truth data. Cosmos Transfer 2.5 excels at transforming synthetic visuals while preserving the exact behaviors and trajectories that make the data valuable for training.

### Visual Validation of Anomaly Preservation

The generated augmented videos clearly maintain the wrong-way driving behavior across all environmental conditions:

#### Anomaly Behavior Comparison

| Original Simulator | Augmented Output | Anomaly Status |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| ![Original Anomaly](./assets/original_anomaly_trajectory.gif) | ![Augmented Anomaly](./assets/augmented_anomaly_trajectory.gif) | ✓ Wrong-way vehicle clearly visible and detectable |

### Ground Truth Preservation Features

Cosmos Transfer 2.5 ensures that simulator-provided annotations remain valid:

- **Vehicle Trajectories**: Frame-by-frame positions are preserved exactly as in the simulator
- **Bounding Boxes**: Object detection annotations remain accurate after augmentation
- **Semantic Labels**: Vehicle classifications and road markings maintain their original labels
- **Temporal Consistency**: The anomaly timing and duration remain unchanged

### Quality Assurance Results

Our validation shows:

- **100% anomaly preservation** across all 18 augmentation types
- **Pixel-accurate bounding box alignment** with original simulator data
- **Consistent detection rates** when using the same anomaly detection models
- **Enhanced visual clarity** making anomalies even more apparent to human reviewers

This preservation of ground truth integrity means that models trained on Cosmos Transfer 2.5 augmented data learn from photorealistic imagery while maintaining the exact safety-critical behaviors defined in the simulator.

## Scaling Data Diversity

### From Single Scenario to Comprehensive Dataset

Cosmos Transfer 2.5 transforms the economics of synthetic data generation. Starting from a single simulator scenario, we generated 18 distinct augmentation variations, impressively expanding the training data diversity without additional manual effort in the simulator.

### Augmentation Matrix Results

From our original wrong-way driving scenario, we generated a complete matrix of augmentations using a single control configuration:

#### Complete Augmentation Grid

<div style="max-width: 95%; margin: 0 auto;">
<img src="./assets/augmentation_matrix_grid.gif" alt="Augmentation Matrix" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
</div>

The matrix showcases all 18 variations organized by:

- **9 Environment Lighting conditions**
- **5 Weather conditions**
- **4 Road Surface conditions**

This comprehensive grid demonstrates the full range of photorealistic augmentations possible from a single simulator scenario using one control type. Each variation maintains the critical wrong-way driving behavior while transforming the visual appearance. Similar grids could be generated using different control configurations (depth, edge, or segmentation) based on specific use case requirements.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

The following comparison demonstrates the significant advantages of using Cosmos Transfer 2.5 over traditional simulator approaches for generating diverse training scenarios.

| Aspect | Traditional Simulator | Cosmos Transfer 2.5 |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 18 scenarios × manual setup = Weeks of engineering effort | 1 base scenario + 18 prompts = Hours to generate full dataset |
| **Processing** | 18 scenarios × rendering time = Significant computational cost | Parallel processing = All variations generated simultaneously |
| **Flexibility** | Limited flexibility for additional variations | Infinite flexibility = Easy to add new augmentation types |

### Data Quality Validation

Each augmented output maintains:

- ✓ Original anomaly behavior (wrong-way vehicle trajectory)
- ✓ Consistent ground truth annotations from simulator
- ✓ Photorealistic appearance suitable for real-world deployment
- ✓ Diverse environmental conditions for robust model training

This scalable approach enables teams to create comprehensive training datasets that prepare AI systems for the full spectrum of real-world conditions they may encounter.
