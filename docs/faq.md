## General Questions

### What is NVIDIA Cosmos?

NVIDIA Cosmos is a world foundation model (WFM) development platform for physical AI applications. The platform includes pre-trained multimodal models for generating world states as videos and physical AI reasoning, along with tokenizers, guardrails, data-processing pipelines, and post-training scripts.

### What are the main components of Cosmos?

#### Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs)

Cosmos world foundation models (WFMs) are pretrained generative AI models for virtual world generation to advance physical AI. The WFM family includes:

- **Cosmos Predict** for generating future world states as videos
- **Cosmos Transfer** for conditioned synthetic data
- **Cosmos Reason** for physical AI reasoning

These models are fully customizable to develop specialized physical AI models.

#### Cosmos Curator

GPU-accelerated video preprocessing and curation toolkit for preparing high-quality datasets.

#### Cosmos Tokenizer

To efficiently convert visual data into tokens.

### Who is Cosmos designed for?

Cosmos is designed for developers and ISVs working in the following domains:

- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Simulation
- Computer vision applications

### What are the technical capabilities of the Cosmos platform?

The Cosmos platform provides the following capabilities:

- Pre-trained world foundation models (WFMs) for immediate deployment
- GPU-accelerated data processing and curation tools
- Post-training frameworks for domain-specific adaptation
- CUDA-optimized inference and training pipelines

## Models

### What are the main use cases for Cosmos?

#### Data Curation

Cosmos Curator provides video data processing and search capabilities for large-scale real or synthetic datasets used in physical AI model training.

#### Synthetic Data Generation

Cosmos models support synthetic data generation through:

- **Cosmos Predict**: Generates synthetic data from text prompts or image pairs, producing predictive or interpolated frames
- **Cosmos Transfer**: Processes 3D scenes from Omniverse to generate photorealistic data across diverse environments and lighting conditions
- **Cosmos Reason**: Evaluates synthetic data quality and generates captions for data curation

#### Post-training

Cosmos WFMs support customization for domain-specific applications through post-training, enabling modification of:

- Output type and format
- Output quantity and resolution
- Output quality and style
- Output perspective and viewpoint

### How do Cosmos models differ from other video foundation models?

Cosmos world foundation models are designed specifically for physical AI applications. The models are openly available and customizable, with Cosmos Predict and Cosmos Reason supporting post-training for autonomous vehicle, robotics, and vision-action generation models.

### What is Policy Initialization?

Policy Initialization is the process of developing a policy model from the world foundation model (WFM) by modifying its output head. A Policy model maps observed states (e.g. video) to actions. It can be initialized by post-training a Cosmos world foundation model with a new output head tailored for action selection (from video head → action head).

### What is Policy Evaluation?

Policy Evaluation is the process of assessing a trained policy model. It can be done by conditioning with/seeding specific inputs (e.g. actions or instructions) and analyzing model output. This step ensures that the model correctly maps states to actions and performs as expected in real-world or simulated environments.

### Can Cosmos be used for creative content generation?

Cosmos models can generate video content under the NVIDIA Open Model License, but the platform is primarily designed for physical AI applications rather than creative content generation.

### What is multiverse simulation?

Multiverse simulation involves generating multiple future outcomes from a given state. Cosmos, integrated with NVIDIA Omniverse, enables simulation of multiple scenarios for tasks such as predictive maintenance and autonomous decision-making.

### Is Cosmos Reason a VLM, VLA, or MLLM?

Cosmos-Reason1 is a physical reasoning engine designed to analyze real-world scenarios through natural language explanations. It functions as a Vision Language Model (VLM) or a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning built-in. Unlike Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which map sensory inputs to executable actions, Cosmos-Reason1 employs hierarchical ontologies for space, time, and physics to generate text-based reasoning traces about safety, causality, and object interactions.

### What does Cosmos Reason output?

While VLAs output motor commands, Cosmos-Reason1 produces insights in text like "The slope exceeds the vehicle's tilt tolerance" that require translation layers for robotic execution. The models can do high-level planning and explainable safety checks but cannot directly control actuators or navigate dynamic environments.

## Technical Details

### What is 3D consistency, and how is it tested?

3D consistency measures how well models maintain spatial alignment in 3D scenes. Cosmos testing methodology:

**Test Setup**: Static scenes from 500 curated videos using the following metrics:

- Geometric consistency (e.g. Sampson error, pose estimation)
- View synthesis consistency (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS)

**Key Metrics**:

- **Sampson error**: Lower values indicate better geometric accuracy
- **Pose estimation success rate**: Higher percentages reflect better camera alignment
- **PSNR and SSIM**: Higher scores indicate higher quality in synthesized views
- **LPIPS**: Lower values indicate better perceptual similarity

### What is physics alignment, and how is it evaluated?

Physics alignment tests models' ability to simulate physical dynamics like gravity and collisions.

**Evaluation Method**: Controlled scenarios in virtual environments, assessed with multiple metrics

**Key Metrics**:

- **PSNR**: Higher values show less noise and better pixel accuracy
- **SSIM**: Higher values reflect better visual fidelity
- **DreamSim**: Evaluates semantic consistency of objects and motion
- **IoU**: Measures overlap between predicted and actual object regions for alignment with physical expectations

### What precision strategy do the Cosmos world foundation models use?

**Training Strategy**: Mixed-precision approach
