## Overview

| **Model** | **Workload** | **Use Case** |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Cosmos Transfer 2.5| Inference | Sim to real using different controlnets |

## Example 1:

- **Edge control**: The model extracts the edges from the input video and creates a edge video from the user input. It then uses this control video along with the prompt/ text to generate the final output.

**Inference command**
```Json
{
    "seed": 1,
    "prompt_path": "assets/prompt_robot.json",            // Update the prompt in the json file as per the input selected from below table
    "output_dir": "outputs/robot",            
    "video_path": "assets/kitchen_stove_input.mp4",      // change the name of input file to one of them from below table
    "guidance":7,
    "edge": {
        "control_weight": 1
    }
}
```

## Example 2:

- **Multi control**: The model uses different control nets, each with different control weights to produce an output. This gives the user more control over how the output would look like.

**Inference command**
```Json
{
    "seed": 2000,
    "prompt_path": "assets/prompt_kitchen2.json",
    "video_path": "assets/kitchen2_cg.mp4",
    "guidance": 2,
    "depth": {
        "control_path": "assets/kitchen2_depth.mp4",
        "control_weight": 0.6
