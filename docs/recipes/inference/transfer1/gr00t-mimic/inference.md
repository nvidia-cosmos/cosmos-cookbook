## Overview

| **Model** | **Workload** | **Use Case** |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Cosmos Transfer 1 | Inference | Synthetic manipulation motion generation for humanoid robots |

Isaac GR00T-Mimic is a reference workflow for creating large-scale synthetic motion trajectories for robot manipulation from minimal human demonstrations. Built on **NVIDIA Omniverseâ„¢** and **Cosmos Transfer 1**, this blueprint addresses the challenge of limited real-world data by generating physically accurate synthetic demonstrations.

## Key Features

- **Data Amplification**: Generate exponentially large amounts of trajectories from small demonstration sets
- **Physical Accuracy**: Leverage simulation for physically plausible motion generation
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduce expensive and time-consuming real-world data collection
- **Generalization**: Provide diversity needed for robust robot learning models

## How It Works

1. **Human Demonstrations**: Start with a small number of human manipulation demonstrations
2. **Simulation**: Use Isaac Sim and Omniverse for physically accurate environment simulation
3. **Motion Synthesis**: Apply Cosmos Transfer 1 to generate diverse manipulation trajectories
4. **Policy Training**: Train imitation learning models on the synthetic dataset

## Applications

- Humanoid robot manipulation tasks
- Object grasping and placement
- Tool use and manipulation
- Dexterous hand control
