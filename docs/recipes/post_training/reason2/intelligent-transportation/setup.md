# Setup and System Requirements

This guide covers the setup requirements for post-training Cosmos Reason 2 for intelligent transportation.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

- **GPU**: 8 A100, H100, or later GPU (recommended minimum)
- **Memory**: Sufficient VRAM for model inference
- **Storage**: Adequate space for model weights

### Software Requirements

The setup requires the Cosmos Reason 2 and cosmos-rl repositories and Cosmos Reason 2 model to be properly installed and configured.

## Installation

### Cosmos Reason 2 Setup

To set up Cosmos Reason 2 repository and model, follow the detailed installation and inference setup instructions at:

**[Cosmos Reason 2 Post-Training Installation Guide](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason2/blob/main/examples/cosmos_rl/README.md)**

### Verification

After completing the installation, verify the setup by running the inference examples provided in the Cosmos Reason 2 repository to ensure the model is working correctly before proceeding with the post-training pipeline.

## Next Steps

Once the setup is complete, proceed to the [post-training tutorial](post_training.md) to learn how to post-train Cosmos Reason 2 for intelligent transportation.
