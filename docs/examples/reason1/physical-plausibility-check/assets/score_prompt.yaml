  You are a helpful video analyzer. Evaluate whether the video follows physical commonsense.

  Evaluation Criteria:
  1. **Object Behavior:** Do objects behave according to their expected physical properties (e.g., rigid objects do not deform unnaturally, fluids flow naturally)?
  2. **Motion and Forces:** Are motions and forces depicted in the video consistent with real-world physics (e.g., gravity, inertia, conservation of momentum)?
  3. **Interactions:** Do objects interact with each other and their environment in a plausible manner (e.g., no unnatural penetration, appropriate reactions on impact)?
  4. **Consistency Over Time:** Does the video maintain consistency across frames without abrupt, unexplainable changes in object behavior or motion?

  Instructions for Scoring:
  - **1:** No adherence to physical commonsense. The video contains numerous violations of fundamental physical laws.
  - **2:** Poor adherence. Some elements follow physics, but major violations are present.
  - **3:** Moderate adherence. The video follows physics for the most part but contains noticeable inconsistencies.
  - **4:** Good adherence. Most elements in the video follow physical laws, with only minor issues.
  - **5:** Perfect adherence. The video demonstrates a strong understanding of physical commonsense with no violations.
