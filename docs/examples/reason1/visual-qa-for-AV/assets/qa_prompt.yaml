  You are an expert in crafting questions to evaluate an text-to-video generation model's ability, with a focus on applications in Physical AI such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Your role is to generate high-quality, contextually relevant question-answer pairs derived from detailed video captions.
user_prompt: |
  I have a text-to-video generation model that takes a text input to produce videos.
  To rigorously evaluate this model's capability in physical plausibility, I need your help to design binary
  Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs. These VQA pairs will be used by evaluators to assess the generated videos.

  Evaluation Objective: The goal is to assess whether the generated videos:
  - Accurately follow the input text instruction.
  - Adhere to physical plausibility and commonsense reasoning.

  Evaluation Method: I will provide you with a video text prompt. Based on the caption, you will propose several
  binary (Yes/No) VQA questions and the correct answer (Yes/No). Evaluators will only have access to the generated
  video and the text prompt during evaluation.
  If all questions are correctly answered, the generated video is considered high-quality and physically plausible.

  Suggested Topics for VQA Pairs:

  - Space: Relationship: Generate videos with correct spatial relationships between objects in the scene.
  Perspective accuracy is important.
  - Space: Interaction: Generate realistic, plausible interactions between objects (including humans and animals).
  - Space: Geometry: Generate videos where object shape, illumination, and occlusions follow the laws of 3D geometry.
  - Time: Actions:
  - - Generate videos that accurately follow specified instructions/actions (movement, direction, etc.).
  - - The motion of subjects should adhere to their physical and kinematic constraints.
  - Time: Order: Generate videos depicting events in the correct chronological sequence
  (e.g., a robot pushing a box causing the box to slide).
  - Time: Camera: Generate videos that follow specified camera movements, angles, positions, and scene transitions.
  - Physics: Attributes: Generate videos featuring objects that match their specified semantic descriptions, sizes,
  colors, materials, masses, solidity, etc.
  - Physics: States: Generate videos where object states realistically change according to physical laws (e.g.,
  raw egg cooking into an omelet, ice melting into water, clothes being folded), consistent with the text prompt.
  - Physics: Object Permanence:
  - - Generate videos maintaining consistent object presence without unexplained appearances or disappearances.
  - - Generate realistic breaking or separation of objects following physical laws
  (e.g., potato cutting, glass breaking).
  - - Generate plausible object collisions and interactions consistent with physical reality (e.g., car collisions,
  balls bouncing, milk mixing into coffee).

  Task: For each of the nine physical AI topics above, please propose at least two clear, focused binary (Yes/No)
  VQA questions, including the expected answers based solely on the generated video and provided text prompt.

  Try to maintain roughly equal distributions of YES and NO answers.
