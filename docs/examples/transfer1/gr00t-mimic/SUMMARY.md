# Isaac GR00T-Mimic for Synthetic Manipulation Motion Generation

Imitation learning lets robots learn skills from observing human demonstrations. But gathering enough high-quality real-world datasets can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming. Synthetic data, generated from physically accurate simulations, addresses the challenge of limited real-world data acquisition by accelerating data collection and providing the diversity needed to generalize robot learning models.

## NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Mimic

The [NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Mimic](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/gr00t) blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is the ideal place to start. This is a reference workflow for creating exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion trajectories for robot manipulation from a small number of human demonstrations, built on [NVIDIA Omniverse™](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) and [NVIDIA Cosmos™](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/).
