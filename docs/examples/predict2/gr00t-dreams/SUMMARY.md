# Isaac GR00T-Dreams for synthetic trajectory data generation

The Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint is a reference workflow for generating vast amounts of synthetic trajectory data. This data is used for teaching humanoid robots to perform new actions in novel environments. The blueprint enables robots to generalize across behaviors and adapt to new environments with minimal human demonstration data. As a result, a small team of human demonstrators can create the same amount of training data it would otherwise take thousands of people to produce.
