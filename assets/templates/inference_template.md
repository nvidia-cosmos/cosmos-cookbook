| Cosmos [Model] | Inference     | [Brief description] | Robotics / Autonomous Vehicles / Vision AI | Jan 1, 2026 |

[Introduce your company/organization, project, and application domain. Describe the specific use case, problem statement, and value proposition. Explain why Cosmos inference (vs. post-training) is the right approach for your needs.]

- [Setup and System Requirements](setup.md) *(optional)*

> **Recommended Structure:** For inference contributions, we recommend organizing your content to include the following elements:
>
> 1. **Problem & Use Case** - Define the real-world application and value proposition
> 2. **Model Selection** - Why this Cosmos model fits your needs (out-of-the-box capabilities)
> 3. **Pipeline Design** - Architecture and component breakdown
> 4. **Implementation** - Code examples, configuration, and inference setup
> 5. **Results & Impact** - Demonstrate output quality, performance, and real-world impact
>
> This structure helps readers understand how to apply Cosmos models to similar problems. Feel free to adapt this format to best suit your use case.
