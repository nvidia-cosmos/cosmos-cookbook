## Overview

This cookbook provides step-by-step workflows, technical recipes, and concrete examples for the complete AI development lifecycle with Cosmos models:

- **Inference**: Quick-start examples with pre-trained models
- **Data Curation**: Scalable data processing pipelines with Cosmos Curator
- **Post-Training**: Custom fine-tuning for domain-specific adaptation
- **Evaluation**: Quality control and model assessment workflows

The Cosmos ecosystem includes five core repositories: **Curator**, **Predict2**, **Transfer1**, **Reason1**, and **RL**, each targeting specific capabilities in the AI development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following requirements:

### Hardware

**NVIDIA GPUs**: Not required for local documentation rendering. For running cookbook recipes and workflows: Ampere architecture or newer (A100, H100) - minimum 1 GPU, recommended 8 GPUs

### Software

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04, 22.04, or 20.04
- **Python**: Version 3.10+
- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: 1.16.2 or later
- **CUDA**: 12.4 or later
- **Docker Engine**
- **Access**: Internet connection for downloading models and dependencies

## Quick Start

### 1. Install System Dependencies

```bash
# Install uv (fast Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env

# Install just (command runner)
uv tool install -U rust-just

# Optional useful tools
uv tool install -U s5cmd      # High-performance S3 operations
uv tool install -U streamlit  # Web app framework
uv tool install -U yt-dlp     # Video downloading
```

### 2. Clone and Setup Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-cookbook.git
cd cosmos-cookbook

# Install dependencies and setup
just install
```

### 3. Explore the Documentation

```bash
# Serve documentation locally
just serve-external  # For public documentation
# or
just serve-internal   # For internal documentation (if applicable)
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Repository Structure

The Cosmos Cookbook is organized into two main directories:

### `docs/`

Contains the source documentation in markdown files:

- Technical guides and workflows
- End-to-end examples and case studies
- API references and tutorials
- Getting started guides

### `scripts/`

Contains executable scripts referenced throughout the cookbook:

- Data processing and curation pipelines
- Model evaluation and quality control scripts
- Configuration files for post-training tasks
- Automation tools and utilities

This structure separates documentation from implementation, making it easy to navigate between reading about workflows and executing the corresponding scripts.

## Available Commands

```bash
# Development
just install          # Install dependencies and setup
just setup            # Setup pre-commit hooks
just serve-external   # Serve public documentation locally
just serve-internal   # Serve internal documentation locally

# Quality Control
just lint            # Run linting and formatting
just test            # Run all tests and validation

# Continuous Integration
just ci-lint         # Run CI linting checks
just ci-deploy-internal         # Deploy internal documentation
just ci-deploy-external         # Deploy external documentation
```
